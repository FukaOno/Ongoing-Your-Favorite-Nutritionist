# -- Frontend -- React
Allow users to input their meals from the previous day and dietary preferences.

- Use Figma for design

- Create a form to collect:
  Previous meals (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).-> https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ja/food/diary 
  Dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
  Allergies or restrictions (e.g., nuts, lactose).

- Use JavaScript to validate inputs and dynamically adjust the form (e.g., show additional options if "vegan" is selected).


Present the generated meal plan to the user in an appealing format

- Use JavaScript to dynamically update the UI with meal suggestions.
- Include features to allow users to:
  - Swap meals.
  - See nutritional details for each meal.
  
Example display: const mealPlan = [
    { meal: "Breakfast", suggestion: "Oatmeal with fruits", nutrients: "Vitamin A: 20%, Iron: 15%" },
    { meal: "Lunch", suggestion: "Grilled chicken salad", nutrients: "Protein: 40g, Calcium: 30%" },
];
mealPlan.forEach(item => {
    const div = document.createElement("div");
    div.innerHTML = `<h3>${item.meal}</h3><p>${item.suggestion}</p><p>${item.nutrients}</p>`;
    document.body.appendChild(div);
});
